            The renovation of the buildings, uninhabited for over 30 years, took place following the principles of bio building and energy saving, installing solar and photovoltaic panels and equipping ourselves with a biomass  boiler that reuses pruning waste and the remains of forest maintenance. A phytodepuration plant and a bio-lake were built, and the ancient cisterns for collecting and recovering  rainwater were recovered. The positioning of the crops and the irrigation system takes into account the slope of the land by exploiting  the fall irrigation and reducing the use of energy. Constructed wetlands and a pond to collect rainwater from  the roofs of buildings support the irrigation of the ornamental areas The philosophy of renovations has always been directed towards environmental sustainability; from the use  of eco-friendly materials to the choice of local collaborations for the rediscovery and revaluation of ancient  techniques (dry stone walls, earthenware technique, etc.). We have flow reducers for water, as well as the  collection of irrigation water in the bio-lake and in the pre-existing recovered and renovated cisterns,  phytodepuration allows the recycling of gray water. By looking at these three examples, we can assume that people are getting creative and tactful to create a  strong shift into the green world. These small steps can build the basis for the future of green change. After the Covid, there was a major shift in the perception of travel. The Lockdown enabled the world of  travelers to look for new opportunities, the travel industry showed a major shift towards off-grid travel  destinations, these trends brought in the trends of self-sustainable properties in return it allowed the  industry to look out for new sustainable ways of travel. Small and medium businesses are mainly focusing on being energy efficient to cut back costs of self sustainable electricity. With the emergence of electric modes of transport green travel has now set itself as a  separate lifestyle. This market after lockdown, is getting competitive day by day. With the development of a  viable Strategy and good social media hype, any business can catch the gloomy eyes of the customer with the  new travel lifestyle.

               As we are progressing at a steady pace, the need to dire innovation is a must in the hospitality world. But  why do businesses like these are moving towards an eco-friendly approach and others are not? The reasons  for lagging into the shifts can be explained by 4 factors:

               Many people in the industry are not fully aware of the opportunities and trends. The reason can be either  lack of innovation in the local market or unavailability of resources in the local economy. But many in the  industry are the victim of ignorance. The reason is not the desire for change, just like the Luddites during  the Industrial Revolution. Ignorance is not only for the individuals or groups that are not contributing to  the shift but also for the governing authority for not creating opportunities and policies for the shift.

               Many of the industry managing authorities are unable to move for the shift. The reason is not  understanding the shift, but the change in the business model and fear of losing a client base are the leading  reasons. In developing countries, the client base hasn’t matured in realizing the fact that some changes in  travel behaviors can have a long-lasting impact on the environment. Also, businesses are not doing much to  the awareness. If not for awareness, it can be a step up charge for developing new strategies to equip their  client base.

               Many local hospitality accommodations are reluctant for the shift due to challenges for procurement and  installation of resources that are environment friendly. The main driving factor for the challenge is the  inadequacy of the local authority to make the resources available at a larger scale.

               The organizational hierarchy plays a pivotal role in the naïve approach to the trend in medium businesses.  The organization’s responsibilities demand a person to act with the activities that are assigned and not allow  the think tank to change. Suppose the organization sums up their courage to equip themselves. In that case,  the training and development will be limited to a few individuals, and the implementation of the framework  will again require a considerable amount of time.

               The green revolution in hospitality presents both a challenge and an opportunity for small and medium sized hotels and resorts. While the larger industry players have made significant strides in adopting  sustainable practices, smaller businesses face barriers such as limited resources, lack of knowledge, and  resistance to business model changes. However, as consumer demand for sustainable travel experiences  grows, these businesses have the potential to carve out a niche by embracing eco-friendly practices that align  with emerging trends. By focusing on cost-effective and manageable solutions such as energy efficiency, waste reduction, water  conservation, and sustainable guest experiences, small and medium-sized hotels can not only reduce their  environmental impact but also attract a growing segment of environmentally conscious travelers. The  examples of AlpHoliday Dolomiti, Hotel Les Pilotes, and BagolArea EcoFarm illustrate that even modest  investments in sustainability can yield meaningful results, both for the environment and the bottom line. While challenges remain, the momentum toward sustainability is undeniable, and small hotels have a  unique opportunity to lead the way in their communities by adopting innovative and sustainable practices.  With the right support, education, and resources, these businesses can become integral players in the green  revolution, creating a lasting positive impact on the environment and the future of hospitality
